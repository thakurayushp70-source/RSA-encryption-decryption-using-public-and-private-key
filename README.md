#definition
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the most widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. It uses two different keys – a Public Key for encryption and a Private Key for decryption. The algorithm ensures secure communication over an insecure channel. Any data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key

Outcomes/Learning:
By the end of this practical, we will be able to learn:
•	Understand the importance of asymmetric encryption in security.
•	Generate RSA public and private key pairs using an online tool.
•	Encrypt a message using the RSA public key.
•	Decrypt a ciphertext using the RSA private key.
•	Verify that the decrypted message is the same as the original input message.
