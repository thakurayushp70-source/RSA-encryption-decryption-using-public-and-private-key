#definition
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the most widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. It uses two different keys – a Public Key for encryption and a Private Key for decryption. The algorithm ensures secure communication over an insecure channel. Any data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key
